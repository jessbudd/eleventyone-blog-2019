### Making React Apps Accessible: It's easier than you think

<!-- <p class="duration">Duration: 25 and 55 minute versions</p> -->

Javascript frameworks get a bad rap when it comes to accessibility. But is it the frameworks creating the barriers, or us as the developers?

Follow me on a React journey through div soup, past the lost focus and under the unchanged titles. Find out: is there actually anything in React preventing us from building accessible web apps? You'll get a high level overview of fundamental issues, how to address them, and how to ensure your website is accessible and inclusive to all.


### Designing & Developing Accessible Web Forms: Pitfalls to avoid

<!-- <p class="duration">Duration: 25 and 55 minute versions</p> -->

Every meaningful interaction on the web is achieved with a form of some kind - letting users sign up to your service, contact you via your website, buy your product, and so on. Although creating a form can be as simple as adding text boxes and radio buttons, ensuring your form meets accessibility guidelines and can be used by people with disabilities requires a little more thought.

In this talk, we'll learn how to avoid common pitfalls when designing and developing forms for your website. You'll learn why you need labels, how to prevent users from making mistakes and how to help your users complete your form with ease.

### Live Life in Beta: What software development can teach us about life

<!-- <p class="duration">Duration: 25 minutes</p> -->
When we release a beta version of a product, we generally understand it will have bugs. And we're okay with that, because hey â€” it's not the final product. We're testing and learning and gathering insights that will improve the future product.

What if we applied this same principle to our lives? What could we achieve and experience if we adopted the mindset of being in "perpetual beta"?

"Beta" is about focusing on progress, not perfection. Now is the perfect time to embrace this. You'll learn how to iterate on aspects of our lives we're unhappy with, how to practice deploying early and often, and how to courageously pivot when user testing shows we've gone astray.
