<p class="subtitle">I  <a href="/posts/the-year-i-became-conference-speaker"> recently wrote about</a> how I came to be giving 3 conference talks, within 3 weeks, in 3 different states. This is the story of how it all panned out.</p>

The Monday before I set off for my first talk, I had a skype [interview  with one of the DDDAdelaide sponsors](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coffee-catch-ups-jess-budd-simon-cook/). We chatted about my upcoming speaking opportunities, among other things, but something I particularly enjoyed was his reference to my "speaking tour of Australia" - which is a phrase I will now steal, thanks [@encodetalent](https://twitter.com/encodetalent) :joy:

## My Australian Speaking Tour

### Laracon, Sydney

First stop: Sydney for [LaraconAU](https://laracon.com.au/). This was a fantastic event, and despite not being a PHP or Laravel developer, I had an overwhelmingly positive experience. 

My talk was scheduled for early afternoon on the first day.


My speaker friends warned me I would be too nervous to eat lunch, so the lovely [@Amys_Kapers](https://twitter.com/Amys_Kapers) (who was speaking an hour after me) made us both a wholesome, nutritious breakfast to keep us going until after our talks. 

As it turns out, nerves don't affect my appetite :smile: so I ended up having a salad and gelato for lunch anyway,  but it's always good to be prepared! 

In the break before my speaking slot, the venue's AV person Bryce got me all set up with my mic. I was endlessly amused by the fact it was a Britney mic*, instead of a boring lapel mic. 

<p style="font-size:.85rem; margin-top: 0;">*These are not really called Britney mics, but that is what they will forever be to me.</p>

People were asking me often in the lead up to this moment if I was nervous - and honestly, I wasn't anywhere nervous as I was expecting to be. Maybe it was because I kept telling myself nerves were just excitement, and I was keeping myself busy, but I really was feeling pretty good. 

As I waited backstage to be called up, I did some [power posing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4ACeoqEjeA) and slow controlled breathing. I have no idea if these things really help, but figured it couldn't hurt!

And then I was called up.

## What have I learned?

- __Always check your speaker notes before you start talking :laughing:__ It won't hurt to take an extra moment to double check everything is correct, but it will damage your confidence if you're forced to stop part way through speaking to fix your setup!
- __Giving a conference talk is a lot of work__. Writing your presentation, creating your slides and practicing your delivery is significantly more time intensive than I expected. I would easily have spent 40 hours on my first talk. I'm sure it will be a faster process in the future, but it's certainly not something to take on lightly.


## What next?

I guess the question now is _do I want to continue applying to speak at conferences?_

Due to the big time commitment of giving a talk, I will be quite selective on which conferences I apply to speak at. Community events that are outside my state will probably be off the list for a while, as the cost of flights and accommodation aren't something I can really afford. 

I'd really love to speak at an international conference next, so that will be my next goal.
