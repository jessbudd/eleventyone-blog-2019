<p class="subtitle">Three and a half months ago, I decided I would have a go at some public speaking. Today, I have 4 conference talks lined up. How this happen?</p>

I suppose it actually all started two years ago, when I was fortunate enough to receive a diversity scholarship to attend CSSConfAU in Melbourne. I managed to use frequent flyer points from years of grocery shopping to pay for flights, and split the cost of an airbnb with two friends also attending from Perth.

So during the next 9 months I MC 3 times. Stage frieight hit me each time, but it got easier each time too.
