~/.bash_profile

 

In your home user folder

 

alias gs='git status '
alias ga='git add '
alias gc='git commit -m '
alias gp='git push'
alias gb='git branch '
alias go='git checkout '
alias gpl='git pull'
alias gl='git log'
alias gd='git diff'
 
alias got='git '
alias get='git '
 

The go abbreviation for git checkout is very useful, allowing me to type:

go <branch>
to checkout a particular branch.

Also, I often mistype git as get or got so I created aliases for them too.

 

Another trick is to make an alias for folders you navigate to often, for example this website which is made with a static site generator.

 

 

Make your /bash_forile file if you don’t yet have one

cd ~/ ls -A

If .bash_profile exists, you can open it with open .bash_profile (or code .bash_profile if you happen to be using VS Code as a text editor, which I highly recommend).

If it doesn’t exist, run touch .bash_profile to create it, then open it.
