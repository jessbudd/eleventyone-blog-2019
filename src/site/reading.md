I was inspired by [Una's book list](https://github.com/una/personal-goals/blob/master/ideas-and-misc/book-checklist.md) to keep a record of my reading.
<!-- and I thought having a rating system might be fun if I wanted to recommend books to others.  -->

I used to love and spend many hours reading, but when children came along I found it difficult to make the time to read more than articles and blogs. 
Now that I've recently reclaimed some of my free time (and brain power), I'm aiming to read at least one book (fiction or non fiction) each month.
