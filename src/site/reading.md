# subtitle: I used to love and spend many hours reading, but when children came along I found it difficult to find the time or brain power to read more than short articles and blogs.

<p class="subtitle">I was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals/blob/master/ideas-and-misc/book-checklist.md">Una's book list</a> to keep a record of what I'm reading. This list began as a way to motivate myself to read one book a month, but has instead become more of a historical reference for myself.

My favourite books to read right now are autobiographies of female comedians and [cozy mysteries](https://bookishbrews.com/diverse-cozy-mystery-books/#:~:text=Cozy%20mystery%20is%20a%20sub,light%2C%20comedic%2C%20and%20comforting.) :heart:
