<h3 class="h4">Designing & Developing Accessible Web Forms: Pitfalls to avoid</h3>

Every meaningful interaction on the web is achieved with a form of some kind - letting users sign up to your service, contact you via your website, buy your product, and so on. Although creating a form can be as simple as adding text boxes and radio buttons, ensuring your form meets accessibility guidelines and can be used by people with disabilities requires a little more thought.

In this talk, I'll discuss how to avoid common pitfalls when designing and developing accessible forms for your website. We'll cover why you need labels, how to prevent users from making mistakes and how to help your users complete your form with ease.
